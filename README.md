## ❓ Problem Statement

Traditional room booking platforms are functional but lack creativity and immersive engagement. This project explores on building a themed, interactive booking app — turning a routine task into a memorable experience for Star Wars fans.

---
## 💼 Business Model

This project blends immersive storytelling with real-world travel, targeting sci-fi fans looking for unique stays. Here’s how it could grow into a sustainable and innovative business:

1. **Immersive Travel Packages**  
   Partner with local hotels to offer Star Wars-inspired room themes, complete with sound effects, props, and in-room AR/VR experiences for a premium fee.

2. **Fan-Powered Reviews & Lore Unlocks**  
   Users earn points by leaving themed reviews or booking frequently — points unlock bonus content (Star Wars trivia, fan art, easter eggs) and discounts.

3. **Event-Based Bookings (Watch Parties & Conventions)**  
   Collaborate with property owners to offer temporary themed stays during major Star Wars events (movie releases, Disney+ premieres, Comic-Cons).

## 🏅 Completed Challenges

As part of the hackathon, we completed the following bounty challenges:

## ⚔ Challenge 1: Choose Your Colour Theme
We embraced the **Sith aesthetic** by implementing a **dark theme** with bold shades of **black and red** throughout the site — reflecting power, intensity, and rebellion.

## 🌀 Challenge 4: Bring Your World into 3D
To add depth and immersion, we created a **greeting page with a 3D effect**. The main tab **tilts sideways in an anti-gravity motion** and smoothly returns to its normal position, giving the impression of dynamic motion and space distortion — a perfect match for the galactic theme.

## 🌍 Deployment

The project is deployed on **Netlify** for fast, reliable, and global hosting.
